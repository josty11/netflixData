# Netflix Data Visualization (Shiny App)

This repository contains a Shiny application built during the *Coding for Data Science* course as part of my Masterâ€™s in Data Science and Economics. The project focuses on exploring and visualizing the Netflix titles dataset using the R language and Shiny framework.

## Project Overview

The app allows users to interactively explore Netflix's content catalog by:
- Selecting a **year range** to see the comparison of releases number for this specific time span.
- Filtering by **ratings** to compare the number of releases with these ratings.

The repository includes:
- Full Shiny app source code (`app.R`)
- CSV dataset (`netflix_titles.csv`) used for analysis

### Notes
This project was my first practical experience using R and Shiny. It gave me hands-on exposure to:
- Reactive programming with Shiny
- Exploratory data analysis in R
- Building clean and interactive visualizations with ggplot2
